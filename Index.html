        1. Video Games (My favorite games are friday night funkin' and minecraft. Minecraft is my favorite favorite. I also play a little bit of fortnite and roblox. In my opinion minecraft is the best.)<br> 2. Play Music (I usually play piano for about 30 minutes a day. I tried to play guitar once but my fingers hurt a lot. I've been playing piano for about 5 years.)<br> 3. EAT!!! (My favorite food is brownies. My worst favorite food is tomatoes. I also love cookies and other stuff.)
